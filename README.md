# Diregex
A domain-specific language using regular expressions to navigate through directories

# Usage

Once you clone the repository, you should first add the `diregex` executable in
the outermost folder to your path.  Then you can run the program with:

```diregex program.dgx [-p path]```

where `program.dgx` is the program that is being run, and `path` is path to
where you want the matching and dest operations to occur.  See my final writeup
and `test/main-test.py` for example programs.
