## List of things to do for my DSL

####  Priorities (in no particular order)
1. Add dest trees parameterized on lists, rather than matches
2. Improve shell options
3. Refer to ast variables in dest trees
4. Add renaming syntax {file.txt -> newfile.txt}, for example
5. Bug with generators not restarting if one of the matched files was moved
6. --dry-run option
1. If user didn't specify a variable, should it return the top node?
1. Make sure it's a valid program (e.g. all variables refer to something) before running it
2. Specify where the directory is!


#### Deprioritized
1. Specify number of descendants
3. Add interactive ability (to look for next match, terminate, etc)
5. Make regex option, default to non-regex
3. Be able to deal with filenames with many words/symbols
