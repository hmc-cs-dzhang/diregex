## List of things to do for my DSL

####  Priorities (in no particular order)
1. Don't print duplicates
    * Hash dictionaries, to make sure no duplicates or
    * Stop looking if found a match, and descendants have no named variables
1. Add readable option (truncate pathnames)
    * Added it to the semantics, now I need to add to language
1. Optimize searcher so that it's not searching multiple things
1. Indicate if no matches
1. If user didn't specify a variable, should it return the top node?



#### Deprioritized
1. Specify number of descendants
1. Name variables that you can use in an expression
3. Add interactive ability (to look for next match, terminate, etc)
4. Semantics tests, which involves equating lists of dictionaries
    * In tests, don't check order of results
5. Make regex option, default to non-regex
1. Add isFile token
